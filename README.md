# Weekend Salary Calulator

## Description
Duration: 1 day

Created a webpage to take in new employees via a form and calculate the monthly cost for supporting all of their salaries. 

The table of employees can be edited to remove employees as they leave, add new employees, and update the monthly cost based on who is currently employed.
